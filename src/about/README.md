# About
## Version 1 :
Currently, I work as a Data Engineer & Data Scientist at Baania Co., Ltd. My job involves managing and analyzing all real estate data in Thailand. I love this job because it's enjoyable and challenging. I have to engage in business understanding, data exploration & understanding, data preparation, use machine learning to model data, and communicate & visualize the results. I use Python as the main tool for my work.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer, developing web applications according to customer requirements. I used PHP, WordPress, Magento 2,  Node.js, TypeScript, React and Vue on the Linux operating system for several years until becoming proficient. My expertise includes Customer Relationship Management (CRM), server status monitoring, a web-based email client and admin, Learning Management System (LMS), website development using WordPress and Magento 2, and the creation of Magento plugins for shipping methods and payment gateways

I have skills in problem-solving, logical reasoning, positive attitude and open mindset,enjoy challenges, flexibility and I like continual improvement.

In my free time, I often develop projects that interest me or look for additional courses to further develop myself. Besides that, I also enjoy going to coffee shops, listening to podcasts, running, camping, playing computer games, and board games.
