# About

Currently, I serve as a Data Engineer & Data Scientist at Baania Co., Ltd., where my responsibilities include the management and analysis of all real estate data in Thailand. I find immense satisfaction in this role, given its enjoyable and challenging nature.

In my previous role, I worked as a software engineer, focusing on developing web applications tailored to customer requirements. Over several years, I honed my skills in PHP, WordPress, Magento 2, Node.js, TypeScript, and proficiently operated on the Linux operating system.

I possess strong skills in problem-solving, logical reasoning, maintaining a positive attitude, and adopting an open mindset. 

I thrive on challenges, value flexibility, and actively pursue continual improvement.

During my leisure time, I frequently engage in developing projects that align with my interests or seek additional courses to enhance my skill set. 

Moreover, I take pleasure in visiting coffee shops, listening to podcasts, running, camping, playing computer games, and indulging in board games.
